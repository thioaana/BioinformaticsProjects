'''
Say that we have a collection of DNA strings, all having the same length n. Their profile matrix is a 4Ã—n matrix P in which P1,j
 represents the number of times that 'A' occurs in the jth position of one of the strings, P2,j represents the number of times that C occurs in the j
th position, and so on (see below).

A consensus string c is a string of length n formed from our collection by taking the most common symbol at each position; the j
th symbol of c therefore corresponds to the symbol having the maximum value in the j
-th column of the profile matrix. Of course, there may be more than one most common symbol, leading to multiple possible consensus strings.
